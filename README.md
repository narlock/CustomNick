# CustomNick
Enables simple color nicknames on older craftbukkit servers running Essentials.

## Dependencies
This plugin was intended to be built with a Beta 1.7.3 craftbukkit version. Adding that as a dependency to the project structure is required.

You will also need to be running Essentials on your server. This plugin does not require you to have it to build the jar.
