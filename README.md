# CustomNick
Enables simple color nicknames on older craftbukkit servers running Essentials. The need for this plugin is when the Essentials configuration does not contain the settings to allow colored nicknames.

## Dependencies
This plugin was intended to be built with a Beta 1.7.3 craftbukkit version. Adding that as a dependency to the project structure is required.

You will also need to be running Essentials on your server. This plugin does not require you to have it to build the jar.

## Requirements
You need to give your players the `customnick.use` or `customnick.colornick` permissions. Each give the user access to the respective command.
